name="Virtual Tile"
description="A tool for scripting the placement of tiles. Instead of directly placing tiles, we can place a virtual tile that calls a method of a script, and it is up to the script to decide what actual tile should be placed, if any. The script can dynamically choose a tile and modify nearby tiles as needed."
